## Important Notes

The starter code for this project was provided by <a href="https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game">Udacity</a>. The starter code had HTML, JS, and CSS styling to display a static version of the Arcade Game. However, the owner of this Github profile, Lakisha Davis, converted the static project into an interactive one. While this required a few modification of the HTML and CSS files, the owner was primarily tasked with implementing JavaScript's object oriented programming features in the JS files.

## Instructions

In this game there is a player and several enemies (bugs). Your goal, as the player, is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
