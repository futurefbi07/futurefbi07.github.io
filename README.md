## Important Notes

The starter code for this project was provided by <a href="https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game">Udacity</a>. The starter code had HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. However, the owner of this Github profile, Lakisha Davis, converted the static project to an interactive one. This required modification of the HTML and CSS files, and implementation of JavaScript.

## Instructions

Click two separate cards. The cards will flip face side up. If they match, they will turn green. If do not, they will flip back over. Continue flipping two separate cards at a time until you've matched them all. Try to match all cards in as few moves as possible.

Less than 25 moves = 3 stars <br>
Greater than 25 moves = 2 stars <br>
Greater than 35 moves = 1 stars <br>
Greater than 45 moves = 0 stars

Good Luck!!
